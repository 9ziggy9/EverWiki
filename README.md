# EverWiki

EverWiki is an EverNote clone looking to present notes in a personal Wiki format. Notes are created by users and associated to notebooks via topics. EverWiki then presents notes by their associations in a clean, encyclopedic format. EverWiki is geared towards users looking to categorizing personal notes on technical topics, especially code.

General flow of EverWiki is as follows:
* Users register an account and may then create _topics_.
* A user plainly writes notes in an intuitive editor and assigns to them one or more topics for categorization.
* Users can then create notebooks which are logically generated and dynamically maintained via the database relationship between topics and notes.
* Notebooks are stylistically similar to Wikipedia pages and provide for convenient browsing.
* Users can search through their own notes in a convenient and robust way.
* Users may adopt the notes of others in their own personal notebooks via a robust search feature on the set of all notes.

More ambitious elements I hope to implement are:
* Some social mechanism for feedback of other's notes; i.e. a public rating scale for quality of notes.
* A rich text editor and syntax highlighting in notebook page code blocks.
* Data visualization tools.
* (Very ambitious) Rendering of mathematical text in blocks (LaTeX).
