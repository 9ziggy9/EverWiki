# EverWiki

EverWiki is an EverNote clone looking to present notes in a personal Wiki format. Notes are created by users and associated to a given notebook which are then compiled into a library. EverWiki provides a text editor aimed at developers and LaTeX users to easily create technical notes.

General flow of EverWiki is as follows:
* Users register an account and may then create _notebooks_.
* A user populates notebooks with notes via a robust text editor.
* The notebook file tree stylistically similar to Wikipedia pages and provide for convenient browsing.
